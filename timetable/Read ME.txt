1. Time Table Do not Work with out Server. As JavaScript do not allow files acces directly.
Because Local File are not accessible.

2. Make appropriate changes in Config file of time table. ( Add Class, Teacher);

3.There should be no empty space in Section of Class in JSON File.
For example 
            "Section":" "  Not Correct
            "Section":""       Correct

Fail to comply with Rule 3 will result in Partial Render and Script will stop executing...
